# My Inburgering Journey: Tips and Resources


## Lezen (Reading)
The reading section consisted of various texts with multiple-choice questions. I found the reading section relatively easy. The questions were straightforward, and the practice I did with similar texts was extremely helpful.

 _"Tip is to read the questions first before starting on the paragraphs. Most students finish this section in about 15 minutes. I also completed it in 15 minutes but took extra time to double-check my answers."_

## Luisteren (Listening)
This section involved listening to dialogues and answering related questions. Practicing with listening exercises that mimic the exam format proved very beneficial. I used the following resources:

* [Listening Practice Series 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnzORNjSbMU&list=PLXhM-IdBEVjjXsZrVZAf4X94FCBE2tq99)
* [Listening Practice Series 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVFjj-WBnno)

##  Schrijven (Writing)
The writing section required composing texts based on given prompts. My extensive practice with essays and formal emails paid off. Having a strong understanding of grammar and vocabulary made this section relatively straightforward. The exam consists of four types of questions: free writing, form filling, email/advertisement/invitation writing, etc.

_Tip: Focus on grammar, remember some common greetings and signatures, and use simple sentences. For example, "Bedankt voor je hulp," "Ik wil graag weten," and "Het spijt me hiervoor." Although I used more complex sentence structures, simple sentences were sufficient for grading._

##  Spreken (Speaking)
Speaking was the most challenging part for me, and I scored a 7. I recommend practicing with native speakers to improve fluency. Use the following link for practice examples that closely resemble the exam questions:

_Tips: Start with Part 2 and aim to finish it within the first 5–10 minutes. Spend the remaining time on Part 1. During the exam, everyone speaks simultaneously, so keep your hand close to the headset and focus on your sentences. Simple sentences and good grammar are crucial. Manage your time wisely—attempt all questions without redoing multiple times. Results typically come after 4 weeks._

## KNM (Knowledge of Dutch Society)
This section was the most straightforward for me, and I scored a perfect 10. My knowledge of Dutch culture, history, and societal norms was enhanced by living in the country for the past 5 years. I found the following resources helpful:

* KNM Book: "Welcome to NL" (coming soon)
* [Sample Questions: 1000-question PDF](Oefenexamens_voor_het_KNM_examen.pdf)
* [YouTube Videos: KNM Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?app=desktop&list=PLXt14hMCM9FTlSmjlggFZVRHjRxfntej3)

Understanding Dutch society through these resources made the KNM section engaging and manageable.

## Oriëntatie Nederlandse Arbeidsmarkt (Orientation to the Dutch Labor Market): 
I was exempt from this component, which was a relief. This exemption was based on my previous qualifications and work experience, so I didn't have to prepare for this part.
